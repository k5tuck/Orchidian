# Orchidian

Orchidian is a blockchain technology that focuses on the integration of blockchain into game development for game assets. 

The goal is too make an ecosystem that would allow for the decentralization of the gaming community. Finally allowing players to take control of their assets and property inside of games, furthering game developers to continue to push the envelope of game innovation and creativity.
