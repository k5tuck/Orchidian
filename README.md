# Orchidian

Orchidian is a blockchain technology that focuses on the integration of other blockchain technologies into one ecosystem.

The goal is too make an ecosystem that would improve the security of all entities (whether individual, business, government, etc.) on a decentralized network by creating anonymity, trust, and privacy.
